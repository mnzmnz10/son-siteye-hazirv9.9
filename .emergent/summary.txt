The AI engineer successfully completed a series of iterative development tasks for a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB application. The work started with modifying the product listing to display all items without pagination, then resolved various functional and UI issues including MongoDB Atlas connection, CORS errors, currency API integration, product filtering, and category reordering. A major feature, Customer Management, was implemented in both backend and frontend, including CRUD operations, quote integration, and automatic naming. Bulk product operations (import/export, category/price updates) were added, followed by significant UI/UX improvements like a modern package editing modal and site-wide width adjustments. Extensive debugging was performed, particularly for price calculations in PDFs and eye icon functionality, and finally, the entire customer management feature was removed as per user's latest request. The development process involved careful step-by-step implementation, frequent restarts, and detailed debugging based on user feedback and log analysis.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested to display all products in the ürünler (products) section, removing the daha fazla yükle (load more) option.
Subsequent requirements and fixes included:
1.  **MongoDB Atlas Integration**: Connect the backend to a provided MongoDB Atlas URL and database name.
2.  **CORS Fix**: Resolve login issues caused by incorrect frontend backend URL.
3.  **Currency API Integration**: Integrate a currency API (fca_live_key provided) and fix uncategorized products not showing and currency API issues. Ensure all products are returned without pagination.
4.  **Category Reordering Persistence**: Fix category reordering so changes persist immediately without requiring a page refresh.
5.  **New Feature Request**: Implement a **Customer Management System** (customer cards, selection in quotes, history, notes), **Bulk Operations** (Excel import/export for products, bulk price/category updates), and **Visual/UX Improvements** (modern landing page, loading states, empty state illustrations, better notifications, responsive design).
    *   For Customer Management: Name/Surname required for customer.
    *   For Bulk Operations: Excel format should be XLSX with a downloadable template.
    *   For Visuals: Integrate provided logo, use varying brand colors, light animations.
6.  **Quote Naming**: When a customer is selected for a quote, the quote name should automatically be the customer's name (initially requested as customer name - quote - date, then simplified to just customer name).
7.  **Manual Quote Name Editing**: Allow users to manually edit the quote name.
8.  **Save Quote Functionality**: Add a Save Quote option distinct from PDF download, to save the quote without generating a PDF.
9.  **PDF Price Logic Fix**: PDF downloads should show custom price if set, otherwise list price, regardless of the eye icon (discount toggle) state. This applied to both quote and package PDFs.
10. **PDF Euro Total**: Automatically display the Euro equivalent of the total TL amount in both quote and package PDFs, using current exchange rates. This should also be visible in the frontend UI.
11. **Remove Customer Feature**: Completely remove the customer management feature from the application (tab, quote integration, modals).

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack architecture:


Detailed Directory Structure:
- : The main FastAPI application file, containing all API endpoints, database interactions, Pydantic models, and utility classes (like  and ).
- : The main React component file, containing almost all frontend logic, state management, UI components, and API calls.
- : Environment variables for backend, e.g., , , .
- : Environment variables for frontend, e.g., .
- : Python dependencies for the backend.
- : Node.js dependencies for the frontend.
- : Stores the application logo.

<pending_tasks>
- Further visual/UX improvements (animations, better notifications, responsive improvements) mentioned in the AI's suggestions have not yet been explicitly implemented beyond the initial logo, loading states, empty states, and container width adjustments.
- The Excel Import/Export for products and bulk price update functionality for selected products (part of the Bulk Actions feature) has been added to the UI, but the underlying backend logic for *importing* and *bulk price updating* was not explicitly detailed or fully tested in the trajectory. Only export and template download were tested.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate last task was to completely remove the customer management feature from the application. This involved:
1.  **Removing Customer-related states and functions** from .
2.  **Removing the Müşteriler (Customers) tab trigger** from the main navigation in .
3.  **Removing the  section for customers** from .
4.  **Removing the customer selection components** from the quote creation form in .
5.  **Removing the customer related modals** (add/edit customer, quick add customer) from .

The AI engineer successfully completed all these code modifications. The trajectory ended just before restarting the frontend to apply these changes and verify their removal. The backend's customer model and API endpoints still exist but are no longer integrated into the frontend.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Restart the frontend and verify that the Müşteriler tab and all customer-related UI elements are no longer present.
